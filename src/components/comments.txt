1. stop the default behavior, i.e. prevent the form from actually submitting to a file.
2. a special method to make the initial request. It fires off when the component loads. It will run right away and this is where we want to make our request. It is used to make the http request.
3. axios - the http api, an http library to enable us to make GET, POST etc. requests. This line is added after you have run `npm i axios`.
4. this returns a promise.
5. handle the returned promise. The response will have a value called 'data', i.e. response.data will have the array of objects.
6. if error, display it in console.
7. returns a unique id
8. destructuring to pull out the `title` and `completed`
9. make a POST request
10. sending parameter B: the 'title' (thanks to ES6, this is the same as `title: title`).
11. sending parameter C: the 'completed' 
12. handling the returned promise (like #5); the new item is added to the UI.
13. when you post a new item, it returns the item and the id created by it.
